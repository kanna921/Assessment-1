    <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry, 
        which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India
        Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited.[8] In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products
        Limited to Wipro Limited.[12] In 1999, Wipro was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] In 2004, Wipro became the second 
        Indian IT company to earn US$1 billion in annual revenue.[14]
        In 2012, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a separate company called Wipro Enterprises.[15][16][17] Prior to this 
        demerger, these businesses, mainly in the consumer care, lighting, furniture, hydraulics, water treatment, and medical 
        diagnostics, contributed about 10% of Wipro's total revenues.[18][19][20][21] In March 2023, Wipro opened its American 
        international Headquarters at Tower Center in East Brunswick, Middlesex County, New Jersey.[1]
